Good wire, good price, used for outdoor speakers which sound great. Empty spool made great dog toy!
Arrived when promised and fits perfect in a 2016 F250. Seems to be good quality and installed has a very clean look. The design allows the factory 12 Volt Outlet cover to fully close while the adapter remains in place.
